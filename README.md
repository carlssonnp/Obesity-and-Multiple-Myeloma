This study investigated the association of obesity with progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to multiple myeloma (MM), using an observational cohort of U.S. Veterans. We found that obesity was a risk factor for progression of MGUS to MM, as was African-American race. My primary responsibilities on this project were analysis and interpretation of the data using SAS, as well as manuscript revision. Please see the link below to an article written about this paper.
